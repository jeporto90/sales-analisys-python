# Sales Performance Analysis – Python

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data to evaluate business performance, identify trends, and generate actionable insights to support decision-making.

The analysis simulates a real-world business scenario where a Data Analyst is asked to assess sales performance across products, regions, and time.

## Business Objectives
The main business questions addressed in this project are:

- How are sales performing over time?
- Which products generate the highest revenue?
- Which regions are performing best and worst?
- Is there any seasonality or trend in sales?
- What insights can support strategic business decisions?

## Dataset
- Source: [?????????]
- Number of records: [e.g. ???????? rows]
- Number of features: [e.g. ??????? columns]

### Key variables include:
- Order Date  
- Product  
- Category  
- Sales Revenue  
- Quantity  
- Region  

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
The following steps were performed during data preparation:

- Handling missing values
- Converting data types (dates, numeric fields)
- Creating new features (e.g. month, year, total revenue)
- Removing duplicates and inconsistent records

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The exploratory analysis focused on:

- Sales trends over time
- Revenue distribution by product and category
- Regional sales performance
- Identification of top-performing and underperforming products

Data visualizations were used to clearly communicate insights and patterns.

## Key Insights
Some of the main insights identified include:

- [Example: Sales show a clear upward trend during Q4, indicating seasonality]
- [Example: A small group of products accounts for the majority of total revenue]
- [Example: Certain regions consistently underperform compared to others]

## Business Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested:

- Focus marketing efforts on high-performing products
- Investigate underperforming regions to identify potential issues
- Prepare inventory and staffing strategies for high-sales periods
- Use historical trends to support sales forecasting

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
